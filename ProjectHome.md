This is repository is to support software development for the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program.   The UIC program manages the City of Portland permit for  Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) Water Pollution Control Facilities (WPCF) Permit number 102830 issued June 1, 2005.  The application development supports the quarterly reporting, new registration, validation or compliance for UIC modification, system status reporting, and pollution monitoring reports.   The products being developed will all be enterprise level with ability to survive audit of the system thru change tracking system.  The products will include main database (UIC) used for quarterly reporting, registration and compliance applications.  These applications current exist in a single user database system.  A new application to track decommissioning process will be tied into the UIC database.  The  archive UIC database will be used for change management and feature reporting.
The development environment will be using ESRI ArcGIS for geoprocessing,  MS SQL database for storage, and Python scripting language.
