<h2>Rules to Determine Facility Ownership for Regulatory Reporting</h2>

## Introduction ##
The UICP presume BES ownership for ALL UIC that have Hansen ownership attribute of "unknown" or are blank.  This is part of the regulatory reporting model agreed to by UICP and ODEQ.  NPDES & WPCF Permits covers only facilities owned by City.  340-044-0020 - Registration and Inventory and Other Information Requirements, Requires Inventory information to be provided (item (c)) of facility.  The ownership is assumed to be permittee if the permittee reports on it.

The Underground Injection Control Program (UICP) must monitor sumps as required by permit.  Some of these monitoring sumps have changed ownership.  This may ownership change may effect UIC monitoring program.

Under the Proposed Rules of Ownership a found facility that is taught to have been county facility is BES ownership.  Therefore UICP register's and report on the facility.

## Proposed Rules to Determine Ownership ##
  1. If the facility exists in public owned parcel maintained by another Bureau, ownership is that Bureau<div>Example: Parks, Water, Fire<br>
<ol><li>If it was a county facility in area we have annexed by city ordinance then it is a BES Facility.<div>Reasoning: Annexation Ordinance<div>Example: City annexed ROW from county the facilities were included.<br>
</li><li>If we maintain it then we own it.<div>Exception: ownership field set to agre<div>Exception Example: ADH685 & ADH684<div>Questions: Does agre indicates a IGA or maintenance agreement?<div>Reasoning: This is based on fact we do not maintain other agency facilities without agreement.<br>
</li><li>If the facility except drainage from a public ROW, then it is a BES facility.<div>Reasoning: Only public facilities can receives drainage from public ROW.  By code private site runoff must be handled on site.  This facility might be in sidewalk, behind sidewalk (private property) with or without easement.<br>
</li><li>If a facility exists in the ROW and we maintain the ROW, and the drainage is unknown by current models, then it is a BES facility.<br>
</li><li>If we have abandoned or decommissioned facility, because the is a regulatory and maintenance activity, then it is a BES facility, regardless of prior status.<div>Reasoning: Decommissioning requires a Closure Report be filed with ODEQ.  Abandonment is the trigger to Decommissioning process and ODEQ Closure Report.  If a facility is abandoned then it should have a closure report filed with ODEQ.  These status changes are reported to ODEQ in Quarterly Report.<br>
</li><li>If we built the facility or it was part of a BES project then it is a BES Facility.<div>Exception: An IGA indicating it is some else's responsibility post construction.  Then ownership is set to that agency or group and comment with IGA or ordiance number is add to comments section.<br>
</li><li>New construction project within corporate boundary by other agencies or documentation from other agencies does not indicate ownership with out further consideration.  Inquires about IGA's and IGA's to be implemented should be made.  No documents, IGA's or other indicators (the above rules), then ownership is set to the documented agency.<br>
</li><li>The facilities in Private or State ROW and drainage or maintenance is unknown and no addition documentation exists, the facility ownership can not be determined.  This is a gray area and facility need to be evaluated on a case by case basis.  Any documentation or criteria used to determine ownership (easements or IGA's) should be added to comments with an agreement number.</li></ol>
